# Feature specification: Image preservation and local library tools

**Created**: 2026-09-05
**Status**: Retrospective baseline
**Inspected revision**: `33fdd5113be7a2079a51ade63171f3298a811ad9`
**Input**: The owner requested a fleet-wide Spec Kit retrofit and implementation audit.

ImageMagick 7 converts single-frame rasters, applies explicit transforms, and inspects images.

This specification records existing contracts after implementation. It does not
claim that the original work followed Spec Kit. New behavior requires a separate
change contract. Existing feature specifications remain authoritative within their
own scope.

[Legacy contracts](legacy-contracts.md) and [38-tool coverage](legacy-coverage.md)
extend this baseline across existing domain and supporting surfaces.

## User scenarios and testing

### User story 1: Plan a conversion before writing (P1)

An operator selects local files and a catalog command.

**Acceptance**: Without --apply, the command reports planned destinations and leaves sources and outputs unchanged.

### User story 2: Publish verified outputs while retaining sources (P2)

An operator explicitly applies a conversion using disposable fixtures.

**Acceptance**: A valid conversion is verified before no-clobber publication. Corruption, unsupported operations, and collisions produce nonzero status without publishing failed output.

### User story 3: Inspect a collection through CLI or restricted MCP (P3)

An operator inventories files, computes manifests, compares trees, or requests a permitted read-only MCP operation.

**Acceptance**: Summaries do not read media contents, hashes round-trip through verification, and MCP refuses paths outside its configured roots and all write commands.

## Requirements

- **FR-001**: The catalog MUST own tool names, operation selection, wrappers, and generated documentation.
- **FR-002**: Writes MUST require --apply, retain source bytes, refuse existing destinations, and verify staged output before publication.
- **FR-003**: Discovery MUST preserve unusual filenames, reject input symlinks, apply explicit exclusions before work, and reject ambiguous destinations.
- **FR-004**: Image writes MUST stage literal input filenames, refuse multi-frame input, and apply the documented metadata and size policy.
- **FR-005**: Shared library tools MUST provide inventory, summary, exact duplicate hashes, manifests, hash verification, tree comparison, and path auditing without deleting source files.
- **FR-006**: MCP MUST remain local stdio, expose only read operations, require allowed roots, and reject unknown arguments.
- **FR-007**: Batch execution MUST bound outstanding jobs, preserve result ordering, retain successful outputs, and report partial failures with nonzero exit status.

## Corrective requirement from the legacy audit

- **FR-008**: Missing ImageMagick executables MUST retain dependency exit code 2
  through the CLI's domain-module import boundary. Applied operations MUST leave
  the source intact and publish no output; a dry-run plan must remain available
  without the executable. A present executable with an unavailable delegate
  remains an operation failure (1).

## Success criteria

- **SC-001**: Every requirement has a named source owner and acceptance check in `coverage.md`.
- **SC-002**: The listed native checks pass for the reviewed candidate, with unavailable environments and operational checks recorded separately.
- **SC-003**: Retrofitting preserves existing interfaces and completed specifications. Any confirmed implementation gap is corrected under an explicit requirement before it is marked complete.

## Edge cases and operational limits

Validation uses disposable fixtures. No personal library or live service is involved. Native codec support is bounded by docs/requirements.md and docs/formats.md. Docker runtime and hosted delivery retain their existing separate checks. Source delivery does not authorize a new version tag.
