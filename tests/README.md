# Tests

`make test` runs shared CLI, publication, filename, configuration, and MCP tests.
`make test-functional` runs real domain operations on generated fixtures.
`make test-all` runs both tiers and repository-validation tests. All tests use disposable directories and isolated HOME/XDG/TMPDIR values.

Image tests exercise conversion delegates, transforms, metadata, animation refusal, and thumbnail bounds.

Without `magick`, the image functional suite is skipped. Unavailable encode delegates may skip individual tests or format subtests. The unittest report names every skip. CI installs the core dependencies and retains the report as an artifact. Tests require no personal media and perform no network enrichment.

Shared regression tests also cover direct manifest-response round trips, malformed and ambiguous manifests, size-filtered duplicate hashing, and bounded batch submission with stable result ordering.

Summary tests cover extension grouping, zero-byte files, overlapping roots, symlink exclusion, write refusal, MCP access, and operation without reading contents or invoking codecs.

Exclusion tests cover repeated and case-sensitive patterns, relative paths, multiline names, both comparison roots, full manifest filtering, write plans, and folder-packing refusal.
